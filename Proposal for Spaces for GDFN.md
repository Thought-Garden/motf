This is a proposal for spaces, and hubs to join the [[Space Network]] and be part of the [[Global Decentralized Festival Network (GDFN)]], by agreeing to participate in the [[Map of the Future - Mapathon]] monthly decentralized events

---
Please outline potential possibilities for a proposal, what are we proposing to these spaces: 

We are proposing that these spaces become part of the GDFN, a global network of decentralized festivals that celebrate local communities, cultures, and art. By joining the network, these spaces will have access to a community of like-minded individuals and organizations who share the same values of inclusivity and diversity.

Moreover, being part of the GDFN will provide opportunities for collaboration and sharing resources with other members of the network. This can include sharing knowledge and expertise in event planning, marketing, and community engagement.

As part of the proposal, we suggest that these spaces host events that align with the GDFN's mission. These events can range from music festivals to art exhibitions to workshops on sustainable living practices. By hosting such events, these spaces can bring together local communities and create a platform for showcasing local talent.

We also recommend that these spaces incorporate decentralized technologies into their operations. This can include using blockchain technology for ticketing and payment systems or utilizing peer-to-peer networks for communication and content sharing.

In summary, our proposal aims to create a global network of decentralized festivals that celebrate local cultures and communities while promoting inclusivity, diversity, and sustainability. By joining the GDFN, these spaces will have access to a community of like-minded individuals while also having opportunities for collaboration and resource-sharing.

Title: Join the Global Decentralized Festival Network and Host Monthly Mapathons for a Collaborative Future

Introduction:

Dear [Space or Hub Name],

We are excited to invite you to join the Space Network and become part of the Global Decentralized Festival Network (GDFN). Our mission is to create a vibrant, interconnected community of spaces and hubs, such as incubators, university research spaces, and innovation centers, that collaborate, share resources, and participate in decentralized events. By joining our network, you will have the opportunity to engage with like-minded organizations and contribute to the growth of a global movement.

Objective:

Our goal is to sign up 100 spaces, including universities, by the end of the year. We currently have three spaces in Lisbon, Warsaw, and London, and we are looking to add seven to eight more spaces over the next month. By joining our network, you will be able to host a decentralized event monthly called "Map of the Future," where different communities gather locally but connect globally to collaboratively map the future of humanity together.

Why Join the Global Decentralized Festival Network?

1.  Expand your reach: By joining GDFN, your space or hub will be featured on our platform, increasing your visibility to a global audience and attracting new members, collaborators, and partners.
    
2.  Access to resources: As a member of the Space Network, you will have access to a wealth of resources, including event planning tools, marketing materials, and best practices shared by other spaces and hubs.
    
3.  Collaborative opportunities: Connect with other spaces and hubs in the network to share ideas, collaborate on projects, and learn from each other's experiences.
    
4.  Participate in monthly mapathons: As a member of GDFN, you will have the opportunity to host and participate in monthly mapathons. These events bring together members of the network to map out local resources, identify potential collaborations, and plan future events.
    

How to Join the Space Network and GDFN:

1.  Complete the online application form: Provide information about your space or hub, including its mission, location, and available resources.
    
2.  Review and agree to the GDFN guidelines: Familiarize yourself with the principles and guidelines of the network to ensure a successful collaboration.
    
3.  Participate in an onboarding call: Connect with a GDFN representative to discuss your space or hub's goals and how you can contribute to the network.
    
4.  Host your first mapathon: Organize a mapathon event at your space or hub to introduce your community to the GDFN and start building connections with other members.
    

We believe that by joining forces, we can create a more resilient, creative, and sustainable world. We look forward to welcoming you to the Global Decentralized Festival Network and working together to shape the future of our communities.

Sincerely,
