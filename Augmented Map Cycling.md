# Augmented Map Cycling

Map cycling refers to the practice of how we work with creating maps with the aid of a computer. 

## Augmented

The "augmented" part refers to the way in which the computer can support the artist in the process of drawing. In the case of drawing maps this support extends to more than simple vector illustration tools, to include the ability of the computer to assist in laying out the map algorithmically and also for artificial intelligence to assist in the graph drawing process.

## Map
A "map" in the sense we use it here loosely is a yet-to-be-defined form of diagram or illustration which shares some of the properties of a geographic map (it is used for navigation), and some of the properties of a "graph" (it is visually informative about the underlying concepts or data). However it is intended to be a new specific form of illustration which is serves the function of a visual way to navigate, summarise and provide "gestalt" views of an information space.

Furthermore, we are using the term "map" here to refer to more than a simple passive description of a body of information - maps in the context of [[Map of the Future]] are active or [[Perfomative]]. This feature of maps as implemented in the [[Map of the Future]] is described further in the section [[Every Map is a DAO]].
