## Decentralized Financial Conference

A decentralized financial conference is an event that takes place across various locations, each hosting distinct events that capitalize on their specialized expertise, authentic local culture, and addressing the needs of specific communities. These individual spaces within the distributed network collaborate through a unified structure and format, providing a seamless and engaging experience for all participants involved.

### Convergence of Spaces
#### Hubs
These are spaces where people from various backgrounds come together to share their experiences and discuss their needs. In these hubs, students can talk about finding career paths, while farmers might discuss the challenges of sustainable farming. Community hubs act as a melting pot for ideas and reflections, helping individuals and groups express their values and concerns.


#### Shipyards
These spaces are designed for creating and building. People come together to pool resources, use tools, and collaborate on projects. Participants may attend hackathons and work together to develop potential solutions addressing the concerns and challenges expressed in the community hubs.

#### Auditoriums
Auditoriums are designated areas for hosting keynote speeches, panel discussions stages, or presentations that attract large audiences. These spaces may feature live or pre-recorded sessions, and provide attendees with the opportunity to ask questions or interact with speakers as time allows.

#### Studio
Studios are dedicated to audiovisual media content production. They serve as a platform to share the ideas, solutions, and stories originating from community hubs and shipyards. Through various media formats, the studios amplify the voices of the participants, sharing their experiences and innovations with a broader audience.
