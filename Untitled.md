So may 12. Is before me 12. I want the company. I want to basically have a strategy sprint where we really dig deep into understanding what the strategy is because we've been David

2:46:20

that's a that's a tough. What that means is we've been just overwhelmed with just the sheer amount of options and informations with so many fucking ideas connecting left and right.

2:46:35

Need to set some boundaries, which is set some always up for boundaries on imagination. So if you want to actually build something, yeah, so that's the week that's what the week is about is setting constraints. It's also about setting goals. Right.

2:46:53

And creating a global timeline, a global budget, right, which forms the global strategy, right? So we're working on a little bit of the branded stuff as well. But we will basically work on everything as Moti. Right. So that's, that's important, right? That's important. So that's the basically the strategy sprint per se, right. And and now I believe for the event, right?

2:47:30

We we need to do it

2:47:39

quickly. But we also need to just think about our time in sort of this sort of Sprint doesn't mean they'll do anything else. Right, but it's sort of informs a particular focus within that particular week. In which you can get really excited. And you have something to show at the end of the week. And that's the sort of strops that I like now I love it.

2:48:08

I love it of course, even that I need to like assign certain amount of time for it.

2:48:19

But I mean, I need to put it into perspective with other things that I am doing. I don't know maybe I have a job. I don't know. I have a call on Friday. And God helped me.

2:48:31

This is important.

2:48:33

Do you want the job? I mean something do they have rally for two weeks and zero? I'm running depth already.

2:48:40

I need to I need money. So this thing is kind of like diverting my attention from anything else. It's a physical fucking Maslow Pyramid thing.

2:48:54

Anyway, yeah, I'm having I'm selling my my consulting services to a Norwegian feel firm for $10,000 That doesn't euros 85 euros an hour. And it's a second call. And it looks like I'm gonna get it. It's 10 to 15 hours a week. Too many. I need to do that. I need to get myself out.

2:49:20

Because I don't want to have a full time job.

2:49:23

I don't want to have a full time job. I have a fucking startup I need to see what the startup Yeah, you should be selling they have a lot of fucking okay. So we are we have scheduled that we have scheduled that we have scheduled that. That's tomorrow. Right? Yeah, we have scheduled the hardware and this is like I think this is the easiest way to get this. That's the key. That's the key. But the other key is there's another key.

2:49:50

What's the other key? The other key is the hardware is one key. The other key is what other key is financing options when it comes to implementation of the hot weather gives you fucking runway, because, hey, that's a strategy. We got to do this strategy. That's for the sales of that. That's the money that I need to get me through this. Because you're banking that will work. It's just that simple. Because with the right strategy that should work right. So that two things simultaneously should help you out. They shouldn't help you too much, but it should help you all the basic needs should be met for that period of time.

2:50:30

And then that gives you enough runway to break through and you need that sort of structure. It can't be like a single approach because a couple of things has happened but we should then talk about that as a spirit. Why are we talking about that as a spirit?

2:50:48

Because that's should be the focus right? For me at least if you want me to help you or longer term I need to feel this.

2:50:56

I think that's should be the week that we're talking about.

2:51:02

Especially between May 1

2:51:08

I think we have this sort of May 1 to may

2:51:14

sort of I'm there on Tuesday. So when I'm out there between Sunday and Tuesday. What's Monday is May 1 Yep, May 1 to May 12. I see it as the strategy sprint

2:51:40

in the

2:51:55

just need to work harder because I it's too long

2:52:05

may 1 to May 6 strategy sprint yes enough time that strategy may 8 and may 12.

2:52:18

Should be

2:52:22

I think some sort of

2:52:26

event production spread yeah

2:52:35

I just need to have like, you know, like time slots for that because we're going to be working remotely. So I need time slots in a day I need to know already on Monday. That's what we're doing here where the lockers are for my calendar. And that's that so so we don't you know, run over time too much. Because, again, I mean, we have to we need as much time as we need and we just plan accordingly.

2:53:07

Yes, and again, like the hackathon we just had which was a bit but I love it.

2:53:15

But it's good. I think it's hard to do that online. Just the fatigue is too much right? The fatigue of being online all the time. But we can do I mean we don't have to have call calls for calls sake for meeting save. We can do co working that way. Yeah, exactly. co working is great. I think then because of this thing, we got task. I mean, we could we could just do task right we get the task we can basically you know turn on the computer at the meeting in the morning and then just keep it up and just maybe turn it off for other meetings means to like feel the presence.

2:53:56

So let's, let's come here because I want to talk about the discuss this together. I'm giving this outline to I think basically we need a strategy sprint from May 1 to sixth and, and then a funk this calendar shit.

2:54:17

I just need a fucking Google Calendar. Because gives me the week so let's take a look at a month. That's the sort of thing we should be looking at. Okay, so fuck that one to six. I think I should be doing strategy sprint. I've been focusing deadly on company strategy and nothing else. But company you mean mobile? The future company Moti. Moti. novel The future is here as a project. Yeah. And then Moti is like, Well, I'm just getting lost because I'm so immersed into every single aspect of it. I'm kind of like hope for a future battery future but for the future for the fucking past couple of weeks. What the fuck is it? Like? Like, how does it fit in the global strategy and how much money can we put into it and how much time do we put into it? And what's the mechanism because that's a strategic move, right? But then establish strategic move and then what are we doing next? Okay, how do we position that sort of discussion that we should be having during that sort of strategy sprint? I need.

2:55:19

I think I already talked about what I need.

2:55:21

So the transcript will catch that. But now we need to talk about from eight to 12. Because for me, that's the production sprint, and the production spread.

2:55:38

We should have more time, but unfortunately, we can do a lot of the stuff before the sprint obviously, right event stuff where we can talk about what the events stuff should be. But this is really the week where all of the branding material comes together. This is where the invites being made and sent out. This is about understanding and this is about doing things that were designed the week before its implementation of implementation really have to be understanding the whole objectives, understanding that event, and what that event experience supposed to be. Understanding all the requirements and building all the checklist basically, assigning roles and responsibilities, developing the whole strategy and timeline detailed timeline. Right, very detailed two minute by minute obviously rundown of the event plus a day by day timeline overall, right? We need that that week for short. But at the same time, we also need to work towards inviting people for the design sprint, and inviting people for the development sprint so we actually have something to show acquiring those resources early on is key. And that's something that towards the end of this week, we should build this sort of missing list because there are some actions that needs to be taken. That is not the focus of that spirit, right? But we need to come up with that those groups.

2:57:19

But um, because I think there's the for example, things like invitation to design, to Sprint's invitation to Sprint's that's something that is a huge focus that we need to look into. Because you got to invite people to the design sprint, and you got to develop in like within the development sprint and getting there because you're talking about maybe like a week long commitment, some sort of sort of a week long commitment. I think, right? That what sort of things do we do, do we pay we could pay some people right because we should right? Because they they give us so much more because of pain. But a lot of the other people we don't pay and we need to solidify right? The the mutual credit story and be able to tell people about that so that we can invite them to the sprints and for for us to be really open and confident about it. Right? It's like hey, that's that's how it works. Okay. It's mutual credit. I can tell you more about mutual credit later. But it's about getting to invite people to the spreads. That is the focus that we need to unlock. Once you unlock that, oh, was your lock that floodgate. Once you unlock that floodgate and you get people in? That's a new model of working that you have just demoed. People say yes. Wow, that's a breakthrough. You asked me that's a huge breakthrough. Okay. So that needs to be focused on for sure. For mutual credit. To work there needs to be some sort of a budget, right? Because otherwise it's just a token that people exchange which is so strong need to forget about everything that we did for that mutual credit that you got to use. Forget about that.

2:59:14

Imagine a different sort of mutual credit now. Okay. So the one that David was talking about is a different one, and that one is basically like a it works. It could work. So token, right. The way you do it is that you provide service, you provide service to earn mutual credit that you can use to buy services. Okay, that's it. That's the whole entire economy, but services within this ecosystem only get more people in the fucking ecosystem that because a lot of people they don't have cash to pay for services, but they think they need services. And but, but what they have is their ability to provide services right? So all the all the fucking freelance, it's basically they now can be in the position to buy services. So you just unlocking that market, and that's it. Okay. That's the opportunity that it opens. Okay. So there's a lot more other opportunities, but you just think about the fact that start with the like this digital nomad fucking, they just don't know how to build a business. They just don't know how to acquire funding, but they can acquire if they can acquire services by providing services. It gives a lot of the fucking grassroot projects, a living chance, a fighting chance.

3:00:38

And that is amazing. But if you think about how to topple the big giants, monopolies and oligopolies in this world, you have to do something that they will never be able to do and the strategy is that you do something so grassroots.

3:00:57

You build a self sustainable ecosystem among the people. Whenever you need to ask the big, big people to invest a sponsor to do anything you have to ask for their permission to basically do please can I do that? I really want to give me money. All right. Well, you need to ask the big big boys permission to do to do anything. All right, to invest, to give you to be a client all right. But if there is a way in which decentralized individual individuals can form communities and can form enterprises that do not use cash.

3:01:40

That's a whole new different ballgame.

3:01:43

So that's it. That's what it's about.

3:01:46

Yeah, that's why they get started. Just wondering, you know, what, before you build the fucking airport system, if you offer people a mutual credit, there's not much they can spend that on.

3:02:00

You do the one to one and then you you explore from that you can do that. But then at the same time, you can also do a lot of things you can do, because the thing is this the thing is just people into the idea without any particular services makes sense. If you explain it correctly, I think it makes sense because it's almost like it's an experiment. Do you want to be part of it? Okay, this new, okay. The way to work is that you will basically spend a certain number of hours providing services to people right to earn mutual credit.

3:02:38

Right. So, hey, if if you're if someone else has mutual credit, they provided some services, right? So you can basically invite create this referral network, pyramid scheme sort of structure, right. So how do you do it? You need services from these people, right? I'm just basically giving you a sales pitch is what you say, okay, tell them a lot of mutual credit, get them to join. So now promote all of the other services that you can't provide for them, to get them to be able to provide a service for you. So that's the sales pitch, pitch. Pitch them, right.

3:03:21

He's great. He's a great He's amazing. Oh, really? Maybe it isn't it?

3:03:27

So that's the strategy.

3:03:31

That's the mutual credit strategy. I think it works. I am inspired by it. I think it's I think we need to

3:03:40

use whatever way possible to get people to sign up to visual credit. Why? Because one day once they're in it will it is like that, once the end it because they becomes this ecosystem and the only way for them that they're not going to reject their own fucking choice to be a pioneer of something new. People are going to say, Oh, you stupid and they're gonna say fuck off. All right.

3:04:05

We need to be able to do that.

3:04:08

Okay, so we're talking about production spreads already.

3:04:13

Stick take a look. What are those routes we need? You have?

3:04:19

The design sprint, the design sprint?

3:04:22

Are you clear about the design sprint?

3:04:26

Design Sprint is about making things clear. So we do that. I mean, well, let's not be so meta, because if that's the case, we will have nothing to show. It's like showing. I want to focus on the showmanship, the storytelling, the graphics, the really hardcore stuff, music graphics, like reuge Okay, I want to invite amazing people in events in many different departments. I'm actually thinking about finding as many fucking people as we possibly can for these design spreads, why? mutual credit fucking works. I'm gonna work on that. story in a minute. Like overall, I think that needs to be worked on, like the mutual credit strategy needs to be worked on so that we can invite people to the spreads and tell them about this exciting thing that we're doing because the whole pitch needs to be something. This is amazing. And you and then they say usually it's like this. What is this? This this is amazing, right? And then they say what I get for this, this? Just that just just two clicks. Yeah, just just okay. Just what is it? Oh, it was amazing. Okay, what I get for it. That's amazing. Okay, great. Say no more. Right. So we need to do as a two step strategy. We get that mutual credit. Right. All right.

3:05:47

Tell the story correctly.

3:05:50

You think they produce anything you just need to like we can use what we have, but we shouldn't really use what we have for them. Alright, so what is about tells a fucking story for mutual credit.

3:06:01

That's should be what we're doing, because that's the key. If you tell us you'll need to tell all the stories ever for user stories, right? You tell the story that is statistically important to tell. The strategically important story to tell is the story that you're actually going to tell the fucking people designers.

3:06:22

Developers, they need to know that story.

3:06:25

So that needs to be so integrated from the design sprint.

3:06:31

earlier. I mean the design sprint is only one in the design in May.

3:06:37

I need designers, visual designers that can actually do the map.

3:06:43

I need front end developers, some front end developers to be there. And who knows how to implement the design and gain people, animators.

3:06:56

UI design work for free. For free, not for free for mutual credit.

3:07:03

Yeah. I mean, yeah, probably most people won't work for visual credit at this point, at least locally. When I think about developers they will just laugh at your face. If you tell them hey, I have this mutual credit you can use for something because not necessarily we're going to try we're going to try but the whole point is we get people on board because there's no brand built over map of the future.

3:07:31

Emotional credit is not a brand. So it's not like it's about brand is about it's about trust. Yes. But it's also a bubble of phonemic sense.

3:07:43

And it's whether or not you can get people understanding what that means. Okay, so

3:07:51

we'll just work on mutual credit strategies, okay.

3:07:55

We'll just work to introduce people to the spreads because that's what we need to do. Anyway. So

3:08:05

okay, now, next thing

3:08:09

I really think the most important aspect of this design sprint, okay

3:08:23

because if you bank on the people not being able to go there, then we won't have much of a stretch. That's the thing.

3:08:31

It's difficult to have a sprint of just us again, that doesn't work for me. We need to take that step. Doesn't it doesn't work. It doesn't work.
