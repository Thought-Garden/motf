# The Obeya Space: A Nexus of Art & Innovation

The Obeya space, located in the picturesque town of Cascais, Portugal, is a unique fusion of traditional Portuguese architecture, modern design, and state-of-the-art facilities. As an integral part of an international creative network linked to London, Warsaw, Vilnius, Madrid, and Wales, it fosters a dynamic fusion of cultural, artistic, and communal experiences.

## Exterior and Surroundings

Perched high, the Obeya space directly overlooks the beautiful Praia da Ribeira. The vista of tropical palm trees, boats navigating the sea, and swallows darting through the sky provides a perfect blend of natural beauty and lively activity.

## Interior and Facilities

Preserving its 1897 origins, the house boasts traditional Portuguese elements like red roof tiles, high ceilings, beautiful wooden floors, and stained windows. The living area, complete with an adjoining kitchen, serves as a prime gathering spot. Its serving windows cater perfectly to food-oriented events. The central space, designed for multimedia art exhibitions, video projections, and sound installations, is ideal for NFT video installations and art evenings.

The Obeya space also offers a creative residency with five bedrooms â€“ three double rooms and two single rooms. It invites artists, documentary makers, scriptwriters, storytellers, and innovators working on video games or NFT art.

## The Network and Cultural Connection

The Obeya space is a key node in a vibrant network of innovative spaces across the globe. It's also the home of Moti's CEO, Pak, forging a unique cultural link between Portugal and Macau.

## The Obeya Experience

The Obeya space encourages creativity, intellectual discussions, and exploration of new artistic mediums. Its charm lies in fostering a sense of community while serving as a platform for individual creative expression. Respecting its past while embracing the future, it embodies a harmonious blend of tradition and modernity.

One of the standout features of the Obeya space is its proximity to the beach. Within minutes, you can walk down to the shore for a refreshing morning swim, making it an even more desirable place for creative minds.
