To create a visualization from the entity recognition results, you'll typically need to transform the data into a format that is compatible with the visualization tools. Most visualization tools can work with standard formats like JSON or CSV. Depending on the tool you choose, you may also need to adhere to a specific structure or schema to represent the entity relationships effectively.
  
1. Nodes and Edges (Graph-based visualization): Graph-based visualizations represent entities as nodes and their relationships as edges. To create a graph-based visualization, you will need to structure your data into two main components:

   - Nodes: A list of unique entities from your data (e.g., persons, locations, organizations, etc.), with their attributes such as an identifier, label, or type.

   - Edges: A list of relationships between pairs of entities, with the source and target entity identifiers and any additional relationship attributes (e.g., type, weight, or label).

2. Tree or Hierarchical Structure (Tree-based visualization): Tree-based visualizations represent entities as nodes positioned within a nested hierarchy of relationships. To create a tree-based visualization, you will need to structure your data into a hierarchical format:

   - Root: The top-level parent node of the tree.

   - Children: A list of child nodes for each parent node (directly related entities).

   - Attributes: Additional information about each node (e.g., label, type, or any other relevant data).
  
Remember that the specific format and structure required for your data will depend on the visualization tool you choose. Most tools have documentation or examples that can help guide you in preparing your data.

Once you have structured your data in the appropriate format, you can use visualization libraries or tools such as Gephi, Cytoscape, D3.js (Data-Driven Documents), or Sigma.js to create your visualizations. These tools can help you create a semantic map or network graph that displays the relationships between entities by incorporating interactive features and customizable visual styles.

Yes, there are several tools and platforms available that can help you extract entities and visualize their relationships without requiring any coding skills. Here are a few options you can explore:

1. NodeRED: Node-RED is a flow-based programming tool that allows you to quickly develop applications by connecting different nodes for various tasks, including natural language processing (NLP) and visualization. It has built-in support for extracting entities using various NLP services (e.g., IBM Watson) and can be combined with other nodes to visualize the relationships between entities.

2. Maltego: Maltego is a data visualization and analysis tool that specializes in revealing relationships between entities from different data sources. It offers a range of capabilities for exploring and understanding connected data. Although it is not specifically designed for analyzing conversations, you may be able to adapt it to your needs using available data import options or customizing it with available APIs.

3. RapidMiner: RapidMiner offers an easy-to-use, no-code platform that allows you to perform data analytics tasks, including text analysis and visualization. RapidMiner has built-in support for extracting entities (e.g., names, locations, dates) from text data and can be extended with various visualization techniques. While it may require more setup than other options, it can be an effective option for analyzing and visualizing relationships between entities extracted from conversations. (https://rapidminer.com/)
4. OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine): OpenRefine is a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it, transforming it, and exploring its relationships. While it does not have built-in support for extracting entities from conversations, it could be used in combination with other NLP tools to analyze and visualize the relationships between entities once they have been extracted.

You may need to explore these platforms and choose the one that best suits your needs and preferences. Additionally, please note that some of these platforms may have limited functionality in their free versions, and you may need to invest in their premium versions to access all features.
