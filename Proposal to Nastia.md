# Proposal for Partnership with Imaguru

Dear Nastia,

We are excited to propose a partnership with Imaguru | Google for Startups hub in Vilnius, Warsaw, and Madrid. Our vision is to create a decentralized global collaborative project through hosting monthly decentralized Mapathon events at your three locations.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Map of the Future

The Map of the Future is a decentralized global collaboration project aimed at uniting people across industries, cultures, and backgrounds. The project's objective is to create a collective and functional map of the future, representing humanity's collective intelligence, imagination, hopes, and concerns. This map will serve as the foundation of a decentralized global collaboration ecosystem, enabling individuals, communities, and organizations to work together on shared goals and challenges.

## 1.2. Mapathon

The Mapathon is a global decentralized festival held once every month. On the same day, different local hubs and locations worldwide gather individuals and communities representing local culture or specialized fields to create their maps and contribute to the Map of the Future project.

# 2. The Event - Mapathon

## 2.1. Intimate & Interactive Networking Event

The Mapathon is designed as an intimate and interactive networking event, where participants create personal maps representing their values, interests, hopes, dreams, and ideas. These maps act as a person's unique identity and provide a foundation for connecting with others.

## 2.2. Connect & Form Circle

After creating their personal maps, participants engage in conversations to find common ground and shared interests. These connections lay the groundwork for forming circles, decentralized collaborations that bring people together to address challenges and pursue shared goals.

## 2.3. Create First Map via Conversations using AI

Using conversational AI technology, the Mapathon facilitates the creation of the first map through deep discussions around shared interests. This map outlines key topics, ideas, and connections, serving as a starting point for decentralized collaborations.

## 2.4. Design & Launch Circles

Once the first map is created, participants design and launch circles as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). These circles establish a constitution, share knowledge and resources, and define clear actionable steps for maintaining and growing the community.

# 3. Map the Future via Conversations

## 3.1. Conversational Workshops

Through carefully crafted conversational workshops, participants explore the future and present maps, discussing challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions. These workshops foster collaboration and drive innovation.

## 3.2. Conversational AI Technology

Conversational AI technology plays a crucial role in the Map of the Future project by helping to create conversational maps that outline the key topics, words, ideas, semantic relationships, and emotional connections between ideas and people. These maps form a context-rich, functional, and dynamic map that evolves over time as more individuals and circles contribute to the project.

### 3.2.1. Create Conversational Map

The conversational AI technology enables the creation of conversational maps, which capture the key themes, ideas, and connections that emerge during the conversational workshops. These maps provide a visual representation of the collective intelligence, imagination, hopes, and concerns of the participants.

### 3.2.2. Create Circle Map

By combining different conversational maps together over time, a dynamic and accurate representation of the true values, interests, and aspirations of the community emerges. This Circle Map reflects the collective intelligence, creativity, and shared goals of the circle's members, providing a powerful tool for collaboration and innovation.

### 3.2.3. Integrated into Global Map - Map of the Future

Circle Maps from various circles are integrated into the larger Global Map of the Future, which represents the collective intelligence, imagination, hopes, and concerns of all participants and circles within the network. This map serves as the foundation for ongoing decentralized collaboration and innovation, empowering diverse communities to work together towards a shared vision for the future.

# 4. The Circle

## 4.1. Goal

### 4.1.1. Future Mapping - To Imagine the Future as a THINK TANK

Circles engage in future mapping activities, imagining and envisioning the future of humanity in specific domains such as global warming, blockchain, AI, and more. This process allows participants to understand potential threats and challenges, as well as discover opportunities, ideas, and solutions that can lead to a better future.

### 4.1.2. Present Mapping - To develop solutions as an INCUBATOR

Circles also engage in present mapping, which involves identifying current challenges and working together to develop innovative solutions. This process turns the circle into an incubator, where ideas can be nurtured, refined, and ultimately transformed into viable organizations or businesses with the potential for global impact.

### 4.1.3. Hackathons - To Build the Future as an ECOSYSTEM

Circles host hackathons aimed at building, designing, and developing solutions that address the challenges and opportunities identified during the mapping process. These events bring together participants from diverse backgrounds and skillsets to collaborate on projects that contribute to a more sustainable and interconnected global ecosystem.

## 4.2. Decentralized Collaboration - The Future Way

Circles embrace a decentralized approach to collaboration, enabling participants to share knowledge, connections, and resources across the network. This collaborative model fosters innovation, accelerates problem-solving, and ensures that the diverse perspectives and expertise of network members are fully utilized.

# 5. The Network

## 5.1. Individual - Global Citizen

The network empowers individuals to become true global citizens by connecting with others who share their values and interests. This process of connection enables the formation of self-sufficient and sustainable communities, united by a shared commitment to address pressing global challenges.

## 5.2. Circle - Sustainable Community

Circles within the network represent sustainable communities, each focused on addressing specific challenges and opportunities. These communities collaborate and support one another, sharing resources and expertise in the pursuit of their shared goals.

## 5.3. Space - Interconnected Hub

Spaces within the network serve as interconnected hubs, hosting Mapathon events and providing a physical venue for circles to come together and collaborate. By connecting these spaces to the larger network, the diversity and unique characteristics of local communities can be celebrated and leveraged on a global scale.

# 6. The Space - Actions & Next Steps

## 6.1. Connecting Spaces to Network

The first step in implementing this vision is to connect the Imaguru spaces in Vilnius, Warsaw, and Madrid to the network. This connection will enable the spaces to host Mapathon events and serve as a hub for the formation and growth of circles within the network.

## 6.2. Start Creating the June 1st Event

Once the spaces have been connected to the network, planning for the June 1st Mapathon event can begin. This event will serve as an opportunity to engage local communities, introduce them to the Map of the Future project, and begin the process of building a global network of interconnected circles dedicated to creating a better future for all.
