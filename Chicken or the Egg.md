Title: The Chicken or the Egg? An Updated Look at the Path to Innovation

Introduction:

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining me today as we explore the age-old question – the chicken or the egg? Which one came first? While this question has confounded philosophers and scientists for centuries, I will use it as a metaphor for looking at the innovation and the growth of businesses in our modern world. So, let's dive right into it!

Body:

1. The Original Debate 

	- Briefly revisit the original question: which came first, the chicken or the egg? 
	
	- What this question represents: causality, the flow of time, and the complexity of cause and effect. 
	
	- Point out that no matter which side you choose, there is validity in the argument. 

  

2. The Business World Analogy 

	- Relate the chicken and the egg to the modern-day business world: demand and supply, service providers and customers, product creators and product users
	
	- Examples: Uber, with its drivers and riders; Airbnb, with its hosts and guests
	
	- Highlight the importance of finding the balance between both: supply and demand, customers and providers
	
	- Connect this balance to platform businesses and their success.

  

3. Updating the Story: Disrupting and Innovating 

	- Discuss how successful companies have resolved the dilemma by finding innovative ways to break the causality loop
	
	- Example: Airbnb's aggressive listing acquisition, Uber's targeted driver recruitment
	
	- Talk about the importance of technology in solving this dilemma: machine learning, artificial intelligence, data-driven decision making
	
	- Touch upon how these disruptors have changed the way business is done, and how they've created new industries and opportunities.

  

4. Lessons for Businesses and Entrepreneurs

	- The power of taking a stand: being decisive is crucial when trying to create something new or innovate
	
	- Seeing opportunities where others may not: having the foresight to identify a problem or a pain point and create a solution
	
	- Emphasize that fear of failure or hesitancy should not limit innovation
	
	- Embrace the challenges of disruption, and understand the value of staying ahead in an ever-evolving market.

  

Conclusion:

Ultimately, the chicken or the egg question may never have a definitive answer, but it can serve as a powerful metaphor in the business world. Innovation demands that we break free from established patterns and norms, taking decisive action to create new paradigms. By embracing the challenges, identifying opportunities, and leveraging technology, businesses can rise above this age-old question and thrive in the modern world. Thank you for joining me on this exploration today, and I hope that you continue to question, innovate, and push the boundaries of what's possible.
