As an entrepreneur with a background in various creative fields, I founded MOTI with the aim of fostering meaningful innovation. My experiences in international concept-driven productions, including animation, music, and poetry, have led me to believe that by collectively embracing concept exploration, we can bring about a positive change in the creative world.
