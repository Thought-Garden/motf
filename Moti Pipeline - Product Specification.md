AI plays a crucial role in conducting conversational interviews and workshops, aiding in the discovery, description, and iteration of the persona.

## 3. Workflow

### 3.1 Research and Data Collection
The system will employ AI for substantial initial research to establish the personas and their corresponding events and accounts.
