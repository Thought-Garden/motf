Exodus is a transmedia creative work that aims to explore the issues, emotions, and possibilities for communities in exile who wish to return home and rebuild their country. The project operates in the space of conflict resolution, addressing various conflicts such as those in Myanmar, Pakistan, and Ukraine. Initially, Exodus will focus on three communities in exile, known as the 3D diaspora: the Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Russian diasporas.
