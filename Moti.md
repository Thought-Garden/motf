## Infrastucture
1.  Collaborative economy mechanisms: We create systems like mutual credit and slicing the pie, which allow nomads, collaborators, and strategic partners worldwide to form functional and cash-free collaborations.
2.  Decentralized event production infrastructure: We design an infrastructure that enables events to be hosted locally in various locations across the world. Media gathered from different spaces interoperate and connect as a global festival, fostering collaboration and idea exchanges
