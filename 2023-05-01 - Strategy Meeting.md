### Separating Product Planning Phase
#### Overview

Matthew emphasized the importance of separating the product planning phase into distinct stages, specifically highlighting the need to differentiate between Phase 1 and Phase 2. He believes that a clear demarcation between these phases will help the team better understand the project's progress and ensure a smoother transition between stages.

#### Key Points

##### 1. End of Phase 1

-   Matthew suggests that the team should formally acknowledge the end of Phase 1, which involves gathering all necessary information and completing the 24 steps.
-   This ceremonial recognition will help the team understand that they have achieved a significant milestone and are ready to move on to the next phase.

##### 2. Transition to Phase 2

-   Matthew believes that Point 1 of Phase 2 should be treated as a separate event, marking the transition between Phase 1 and Phase 2.
-   This transition point will serve as a clear indicator that the team is now shifting their focus from information gathering and planning to the actual implementation of the project.

##### 3. Product Genesis Scoping and Design

-   In Phase 2, the team will focus on product genesis scoping, design, and creating a product plan based on the market data gathered during Phase 1.
-   This process will involve taking into account the infrastructure built during Phase 1, as well as evaluating the investor viability and the team's ability to build the product within the given budget.

##### 4. Setting KPIs and Deadlines

-   Matthew also suggests that the team should set Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and deadlines for various tasks during the product planning phase.
-   This will help the team track their progress, ensure that they are meeting their goals, and make the planning process more meaningful and structured.

By separating the product planning phase and clearly defining the transition between Phase 1 and Phase 2, Matthew believes that the team will be better equipped to manage the project and achieve their desired outcomes.

Matthew expressed his interest in focusing on the research of the 24 steps to determine which of them are most likely to provide the best financial stability and long-term success for the company. He believes that by identifying the most promising steps, the company can make more informed decisions about its strategy and direction.

###### Sub-point 2: Timing of Decisions

Matthew acknowledged the need to balance the timing of decisions with the company's overall strategy. He suggested that all four strategies under consideration (B2B, B2C, hybrid, and digital incubator) require the company to follow the 24 steps and make decisions accordingly. He emphasized the importance of planning and making decisions based on the company's progress through the 24 steps.

###### Sub-point 3: Philosophical Issue

Matthew also mentioned that the decision to follow the 24 steps as a guiding principle is a philosophical issue. As the major financial contributor to the company, he believes that it is essential to be responsible and consider whether the 24 steps should be treated as a "Bible" for the company's strategy and decision-making process.

##### Conclusion:

Matthew believes that the 24 steps can provide valuable insights and guidance for the company's strategy and decision-making process. He emphasizes the importance of planning and making decisions based on the company's progress through the 24 steps, while also considering the philosophical implications of treating the 24 steps as a guiding principle.

##### Main Point:

The debate centered around whether the company should focus on a business-to-business (B2B) approach or a business-to-consumer (B2C) approach, considering the problems and opportunities associated with each.

##### B2B Approach:

###### Sub-point 1: Problems

1.  Struggling businesses: The businesses being considered for B2B partnerships are facing financial difficulties and have limited cash flow, which could impact the success of the joint venture.
    
2.  Market segment challenges: The B2B market segment has inherent problems, such as the need for a more complex sales process, longer sales cycles, and the potential for a smaller customer base.
    
3.  Resource allocation: Focusing on the B2B approach may require more resources, such as time and money, which could impact the company's ability to explore other opportunities.
    
4.  Customization and integration: B2B products often require customization and integration with existing systems, which can be time-consuming and costly.
    

###### Sub-point 2: Opportunities

1.  Collaboration: The B2B approach allows for collaboration between companies across different fields, potentially leading to innovative solutions and products.
    
2.  Investor connections: B2B organizations can help the company connect with investors, which could lead to additional funding and support.
    
3.  Market expertise: Partnering with established businesses can provide valuable market insights and expertise, which can help the company refine its product offerings and strategies.
    
4.  Long-term contracts: B2B relationships often involve long-term contracts, which can provide a stable source of revenue for the company.
    

##### B2C Approach:

###### Sub-point 1: Problems

1.  Time constraints: The company may not have enough time to build a truly B2C product by the end of the year, which could impact its ability to secure funding and achieve sustainability.
    
2.  Financing traction: There is a lack of confidence in gaining financing traction based on B2C efforts, which could make it difficult for the company to secure the necessary funding to support its growth.
    
3.  Market competition: The B2C market is often more competitive, with numerous companies vying for consumer attention, which could make it challenging for the company to stand out and gain market share.
    
4.  Customer acquisition costs: Acquiring new customers in the B2C market can be expensive, and the company may need to invest heavily in marketing and advertising to attract consumers.
    

###### Sub-point 2: Opportunities

1.  Larger customer base: The B2C approach has the potential to reach a larger customer base, which could lead to increased revenue and growth.
    
2.  Consumer-driven innovation: Focusing on the B2C market can help the company better understand consumer needs and preferences, leading to more innovative and user-friendly products.
    
3.  Brand building: A successful B2C product can help the company build a strong brand and reputation, which can lead to increased customer loyalty and long-term success.
    
4.  Scalability: B2C products often have the potential for greater scalability, allowing the company to reach a larger audience and expand its market presence.
    

##### Conclusion:

While the B2B approach offers collaboration opportunities and investor connections, it also presents challenges related to struggling businesses and market segment issues. On the other hand, the B2C approach has the potential for a larger customer base and consumer-driven innovation but faces time constraints and financing challenges. The company must carefully weigh the pros and cons of each approach to determine the best path forward.
