### Phase 1: Setting up Minimial Viable Collaboration Infrastucture (May to August 2023)

In the first phase, Moti will focus on using Map of the Future as a pilot project to lay the groundwork for collaboration and establish a minimal viable collaboration. This phase will be primarily dedicated to building the infrastructure, mechanisms, methodologies, products, and processes that will serve as the foundation for future growth and development.

During this phase, Moti will prioritize developing the following [[Building blocks]]:
1.  **Collaborative economy mechanism**: Develop mechanisms, such as mutual credit and slicing the pie, that enable nomads, collaborators, and strategic partners from across the world to form functional and cash-free collaborations.
2.  **Decentralized event production infrastructure**: Create an infrastructure that allows events to be hosted locally in different locations across the world, with media gathered from different spaces that interoperate and connect as a global festival.
3.  **Digital incubator**: Develop processes needed for different communities to incubate products and ideas that address their needs through a robust, rigorous, and fun business process.

With these building blocks in place, Moti will work on achieving the following short-term business objectives:

1.  **Collect market data**: As a bootstrap startup, Moti will focus on gathering market data efficiently and cost-effectively, laying the foundation for future growth and development.
2.  **Establish functional and meaningful partnerships**: Moti will work on forming strategic partnerships with people and organizations that can help build the product and the business.
3.  **Sign up spaces as real estate**: Moti will sign up various spaces to the Space Network, allowing these spaces to be activated in the future and used by communities for hosting events and strengthening community bonds. These spaces will also become part of the gloabl decentralized festival network.
4.  **Collaborate on Moti's projects**: With the help of strategic partners, Moti will work together on researching, designing, and incubating its projects.
5. **Proactively engage investors as collaborators**: Moti will actively and confidently pursue investors across various market segments, viewing them as essential collaborators in building a robust, decentralized incubator. The goal is to establish strong, meaningful, and instrumental relationships with these investors, which will drive Moti to constantly think about and connect with them, fostering a mutually beneficial collaboration.

Focusing on building the infrastructure first and then achieving these short-term business objectives will allow Moti to establish a strong foundation for collaboration, which will enable the organization to work more effectively on its projects and future phases.
