Strategy Note:

The proposed strategy for Moti aims to create a successful Mapathon event that encourages participation, community building, and contributions to map visualizations, artworks, and apps. The strategy is divided into five sprints, starting with setting the global strategy, budget, and key milestones. The Mutual Credit Strategy will be a central part of the plan, as it will incentivize participation and collaboration within the community.

The Preparation Sprint will focus on marketing, event planning, and assigning roles and responsibilities. In the Design Sprint, the team will collaborate with designers and developers to create an engaging event experience, including visuals and interactive elements. The Development Sprint will focus on building a robust platform for hosting and managing Mapathon events, integrating the mutual credit system, and implementing analytics features.

The Production Sprint will finalize all design and development work, test the platform, and prepare event materials and logistics. The Mapathon event will be launched on June 1, with a focus on monitoring performance and gathering feedback for future improvements.

The success of the initial Mapathon event will pave the way for scaling the initiative in September, refining the platform and event experience based on feedback and insights, and launching additional Mapathon events to reach a wider audience and increase the impact of Moti's mission.
