This market segment focuses on the collaborative and interactive creation of speculative fiction settings, centered around the future and grounded in scientific accuracy, technological advancements, and decentralized governance. It emphasizes the integration of storytelling, media production, and immersive experiences to engage the public and drive innovation in global governance systems.

In Future World Building, a diverse community of creators, including writers, artists, legal experts, developers, and technologists, come together to construct narratives and scenarios that explore the possibilities of the future. These stories form the basis of a multimedia franchise spanning books, films, TV shows, and digital media, capturing the imagination of audiences.

Simultaneously, the franchise expands into interactive experiences, inviting users to explore and engage with the story's world in various ways, such as video games, metaverse platforms, or even physical immersive experiences like retreats, immersive theater, and live-action role-playing (LARP). These immersive settings provide a testing ground for decentralized governance structures and showcase their potential applications in real-life contexts.

The Future World Building approach serves as a catalyst for innovation and collaboration among those interested in global governance, fostering the creation and refinement of decentralized systems. The result is an evolving ecosystem of narratives, technologies, and communities that drive the development and adoption of new governance models, shaping the future of society.
