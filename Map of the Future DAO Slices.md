# Map of the Future Blueprint
The Map of the Future is an ambitious global project aimed at involving 60-80% of all universities and schools worldwide. The goal is to engage the world's best academics, professors, blockchain experts, and other professionals in developing the future of the United Nations, nation-states, sustainable development goals, ethical purpose, and even the future of religion. The map will consist of a billion rounds, with each DAO representing a piece of creativity and joy, reflecting the dreams and aspirations of every individual on the planet.

# Map of the Future - Megalomania
Megalomania refers to the grand scale and ambition of the Map of the Future project. It seeks to engage not only educational institutions but also spiritual leaders, psychologists, sociologists, and other experts in creating a comprehensive map that offers guidance and advice to every person on Earth. This not-for-profit initiative is founded by Pak Hou Chau and David Bovill and backed by Alex's technical and blockchain expertise.

# 3 Layers of Designers
The Map of the Future project will attract three different communities of designers, each contributing to a specific aspect of the project:
1.  Data Visualization Designers: These designers will cater to scientists, academics, graphic designers, and UX professionals who will work on mobile phones and websites. They will focus on creating visually appealing and informative representations of the data collected for the Map of the Future.
2.  Branding and Aesthetic Designers: This group will be responsible for developing the overall look and feel of the Map of the Future project, ensuring that it is consistent and engaging across all platforms and media.
3.  Game and VR Experience Designers: These designers will work on creating a unique and immersive experience for users, incorporating the best ideas from the project into a final mobile app game or VR experience. They will also develop unique copyright protections to prevent others from copying the game style or concept.
By engaging these three layers of designers, the Map of the Future project aims to create a visually stunning, informative, and engaging experience for users worldwide, helping them navigate and shape the future together.
